    <h2>Importance of Mitochondria Health</h2>
    <p>Healthy, strong, and abundant mitochondria make one much more resilient to a variety of stressors: cold, heat, altitude, infection, poison, radiation, etc. On the other hand, mitochondrial dysfunction is a likely cause of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and aging. Oftentimes the events leading up to these disasters involve free radical damage. Reactive oxygen species or free radicals are oxygen molecules that carry more electrons than they are supposed to. Like lactic acid, in moderate quantities, ROS perform many useful functions. In excess, they destroy performance, health, and life itself. Mitochondria are the primary source of free radical generation in our bodies. When there is heavy traffic through the so-called electron transport chains in mitochondria, some of the electrons leak and get captured by oxygen molecules. The latter turn into highly reactive compounds like hydrogen peroxide that go on a rampage damaging the body.</p>

    <h2>Zone 2 Training</h2>
    <p>Zone 2 training involves running or cross-training at a pace that keeps your heart rate within 60-70% of your maximal heart rate. At first, this may feel painfully slow—almost impossible, at times, particularly if you hit a hill. However, over time, your body will adapt and you’ll be able to run faster paces while maintaining a zone 2 heart rate. </p>

    <h2>Interval Training</h2>
    <p>The blurry spot in the tall grass became a straw-colored streak. The antelope made a desperate run for its life, a run that was blissfully short. The panthera leaped. Her jaws, powerful enough to crush thick bones, closed on her prey’s neck. It was over in 16 seconds. The proud hunter stood tall, surveyed her surroundings the way a big boss would, and made a brief “fast and loose” victory dance. Then she picked up her dinner, which was bigger than herself, and climbed a tree with it. “It would be like you climbing a tree holding me in your teeth,” commented George, who has good 50 pounds on me. And that was no feat for a leopard that can climb with carcasses three times her bodyweight.</p>
